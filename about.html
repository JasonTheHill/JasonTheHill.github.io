		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			The goal of this website is to provide a place where anyone can post reviews about the packaging of products. These reviews are intended to only be about the packaging, not the actual product itself. 
			All reviews are made by users of this website.
		</p>
		<h1>Tags System</h1>
		<p>
			All reviews have tags associated with them. These tags may be the company, brand, product, store, problem, or anything else. 
			You can find an overview of each tag, where you can view the average rating of all posts with that tag, as well as a list of reviews that have that tag.
		</p>
		<h1>Post Etiquette</h1>
		<p>
			Your reviews should only be about the packaging, not the product itself. Be polite when making reviews. Include all relevent tags, and make sure they are accurate. Be honest, and avoid exaggerating.
